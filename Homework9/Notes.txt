Use priority queue/min heap and then sort the input edges so you only have to process n-1 edges.
Where n is the number of nodes/numVertex.
Weights.txt corresponds line for line with artist_edges.txt

WeightedEdge.java can create a priority that associates the weighted edges with their edge line. 
Then after everything is added into WeightedEdge data struture you just use PriorityQueue data struture
to create the priority queue. This does everything in linear time vs n log n time.

He will add his own code for graph. Use that for implementing the algorithmn. Should be easy plugging 
in numbers you got this.
