Any solution to a computational problem, improvments can be made in the following ways
1. research into the problem and use existing work (that was previously done)
2. algorithmic improvement ( clever improvement)
3. data structures

After this,
4. code level improvement (lot of little things or tricks you can do)
5. (ignoring changing to a faster processor, or more memory)
6. parallelism - which use of multiple cores on your computer
